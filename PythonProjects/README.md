## Cognitive Services Python Playground

This is a set of demos I use to help build out advanced features. In this first installment, there are two service demos:

- Image analysis
- Text recognition

The second option has a couple different approaches implemented, and you can use all three from the console when the app launches by selecting a number 1-4.

The Text Recognition options will also load the image and draw bounding boxes around the detected words. Here's an example result when passing a code example screenshot:
